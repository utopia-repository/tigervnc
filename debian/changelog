tigervnc (1.1.0-2jf) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-ldnow.patch disabling lazy symbol resolution for libvnc.so

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-rh690245.patch which add TLS encryption to VeNCrypt
    
      TigerVNC (Xvnc, x0vncserver, the libvnc.so module, and vncviewer) now
      supports TLS encryption (using VeNCrypt) which allows TLS encrypted
      communication between a server and a viewer. (BZ#653491)

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-rh588342.patch which fixes EQ overflowing bug.
    
      Xvnc could become unresponsive and the following error message was shown
      in the log: "[mi] EQ overflowing. The server is probably stuck in an
      infinite loop.". This was caused by a large number of user input events
      in the Xvnc event queue, which were being processed too slowly. With
      this update, this issue no longer occurs and the system works as
      expected. (BZ#588342)

  * Add RH patch tigervnc11-rh628054-xorg.patch which fixes vmware keyboard interaction bug.
    
      Prior to this update, Xvnc (the X VNC server; part of the tigervnc
      package) did not pass keyboard input to a remote VMware workstation
      because it did not take into account types of keyboards which do not
      have modifier keys. With this update, Xvnc recognizes all types of
      keyboards; thus, keyboard input is correctly passed to remote VMware
      workstations. (BZ#628054)

  * Add RH patch tigervnc11-rh645755.patch fix signal interrupted read
    
      The Xvnc server randomly refused connections when the reading of the
      password file (provided when starting Xvnc with the "-PasswordFile"
      option) was interrupted by a signal. With this update, the loading of a
      password file continues after an interrupt signal is issued and
      connections are no longer refused. (BZ#645755)

  * Apply RH patch tigervnc-viewer-reparent.patch which adds vncviewer embedding support via -Parent option.

  * Apply RH patch tigervnc-102434.patch which adds -passwdInput option to vncviewer.
