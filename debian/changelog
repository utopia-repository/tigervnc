  * Shut up lintian manpage-has-errors-from-man for vnc.conf.5x.gz
    Basically the default value for $sslAutoGenCertCommand is too large
    to fit into a 80 column manpage output. Broke that into multiple

tigervnc (1.7.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Ola Lundqvist ]
  * Increased the update-alternatives priority so that this package will
    have precedence over tightvnc and vnc4 that we hope to soon replace.

  [ Joachim Falk ]
  * Fixed spurious next cmd; in tigervncserver wrapper script. Leads to bug if
    tigervnc-common package is also installed. Closes: #849996 and
    Closes: #850054.
  * Fixed bug if killing a non-existing tigervncserver, i.e.,
    tigervncserver -kill :17
    Use of uninitialized value $pid in concatenation (.) or string at
    /usr/bin/tigervncserver line 493.
    Can't kill a non-numeric process ID at /usr/bin/tigervncserver line 495.
    Killing Xtigervnc process ID ...
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script. An option -localhost without
    an argument is true, i.e., only listen on localhost for vnc connections,
    not false!
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script. Correctly propagate -localhost
    option to remote host if tigervncserver should start the Xtigervnc server
    on a remote host via ssh, e.g., as requested by the following command:
      - tigervncserver -localhost no <some remote server>:nn.
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script. Now allow -list and -kill
    commands to be executed on a remote host, e.g., as requested by the
    following commands:
      - tigervncserver -kill <some remote server>[:nn] or
      - tigervncserver -list <some remote server>.
  * Feature: Be a little more helpful after a remote tigervncserver sessions
    has been started. Give the user the xtigervncviewer command that can be
    used to connect to the started remote session.
  * Fixed support for security types Plain, TLSPlain, and X509Plain. We now
    have support for the -SecurityTypes option in the tigervncserver wrapper
    script. Moreover, we now ship a tigervnc PAM service file required for
    password authentication via PAM in the tigervncserver-common package. The
    presence of tigervncserver-common will also be checked by the
    tigervncserver wrapper script if at least one of the three plain security
    types is used.
  * Feature: Better support for security types X509None, X509Vnc, and
    X509Plain.  We now have support for the -X509Cert and -X509Key options in
    the tigervncserver wrapper script. Moreover, if the user does not specify
    a certificate and key when at least one of the three X509 security types
    is used, then we will generate a self signed certificate for the tigervnc
    server if it is not already present.
  * Update the descriptions in /etc/vnc.conf to conform to the real behavior
    and options of the tigervncserver wrapper script. Reordered default option
    definitions in the tigervncserver wrapper script to conform to the order
    the options are documented in the /etc/vnc.conf configuration file.
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script. The option $getDefaultFrom is
    documented in the /etc/vnc.conf configuration file, but was ignored in the
    wrapper script.
  * Some love for the -xdisplaydefaults and -wmDecoration options. Now only
    apply -wmDecoration shrinkage if -xdisplaydefaults is used.  The geometry
    specified in /etc/vnc.conf and ~/.vnc/vnc.conf is no longer influenced by
    wmDecoration. This is now the same behavior as the geometry specified by
    the commonalind via -g NNxMM. Morover, use reasonable defaults for
    -wmDecoration for the desktops contained in debian stretch.
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script. The option -useold should
    start a tigervncserver if it is not already running and not complain that
    there is none running. This already worked when a desired display number
    was given, but did not work when no display number was specified.
  * Updated tigervncserver man page.
  * Feature: Implement the -xstartup and -noxstartup options in the
    tigervncserver wrapper script. These options are from the vncserver
    wrapper script shipped with TigerVNC. Let our startup script be compatible
    with theirs. These options are already documented in the updated
    tigervncserver man page.
  * Security hardening: The user can easily expose a VNC server to the
    internet without any authentication by specifying tigervncserver
    -localhost no -SecurityTypes None|TLSNone|X509None.  Moreover, previously
    we switched the default from -localhost yes to -localhost no when a TLS*
    or X509* security type was given via -SecurityTypes. From now on, we will
    give a stern warning and refuse to start the VNC server when a *None
    security type is combined with -localhost no. To continue, the user has to
    provide the option --I-KNOW-THIS-IS-INSECURE.  If a *None security type is
    used with localhost access, the user will merely get a polite warning.
  * Fixed bug in tigervncserver wrapper script when options are forwarded to a
    remote tigervncserver script. In this case, the ssh call introduces one
    level of shell execution. Thus, the options must be shell escaped.
  * Updated vnc.conf man page.

tigervnc (1.7.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Make include /usr/share/xserver-xorg/configure_flags.mk optional.
    This change enables the creation of a source deb without having all the
    build dependencies installed, i.e., dpkg-buildpackage -d -S.
  * Fixed stale pidfile condition detection and cleanup in tigervncserver
    wrapper script.
  * Fixed syntax error in tigervncserver wrapper script. Closes: #849963.
  * Fixed default startup script generation in tigervncserver wrapper script
    if the user specifies a custom vncStartup, e.g.,

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-ldnow.patch disabling lazy symbol resolution for libvnc.so

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-rh690245.patch which add TLS encryption to VeNCrypt
    
      TigerVNC (Xvnc, x0vncserver, the libvnc.so module, and vncviewer) now
      supports TLS encryption (using VeNCrypt) which allows TLS encrypted
      communication between a server and a viewer. (BZ#653491)

  * Added RH patch tigervnc11-rh588342.patch which fixes EQ overflowing bug.
    
      Xvnc could become unresponsive and the following error message was shown
      in the log: "[mi] EQ overflowing. The server is probably stuck in an
      infinite loop.". This was caused by a large number of user input events
      in the Xvnc event queue, which were being processed too slowly. With
      this update, this issue no longer occurs and the system works as
      expected. (BZ#588342)

  * Add RH patch tigervnc11-rh628054-xorg.patch which fixes vmware keyboard interaction bug.
    
      Prior to this update, Xvnc (the X VNC server; part of the tigervnc
      package) did not pass keyboard input to a remote VMware workstation
      because it did not take into account types of keyboards which do not
      have modifier keys. With this update, Xvnc recognizes all types of
      keyboards; thus, keyboard input is correctly passed to remote VMware
      workstations. (BZ#628054)

  * Add RH patch tigervnc11-rh645755.patch fix signal interrupted read
    
      The Xvnc server randomly refused connections when the reading of the
      password file (provided when starting Xvnc with the "-PasswordFile"
      option) was interrupted by a signal. With this update, the loading of a
      password file continues after an interrupt signal is issued and
      connections are no longer refused. (BZ#645755)

  * Apply RH patch tigervnc-viewer-reparent.patch which adds vncviewer embedding support via -Parent option.
